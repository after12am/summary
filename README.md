Summary
=======

Summary is a python module to extract main content from the web page. 
This was originally implemented by Nakatani Shuyo with ruby. 
His strategy and implementation about extraction is great. But there is room for improvement. 
The extracted content includes the garbages, e.g. comments of blog entry. 
I improved not to extract those as increasing of precision of calculating Layout Block, upon implementing with python. 
And also Summary extracts not only main content but also appropriate title, even if being broken page.


strategy is:

```
1. removes the unnecessary elements from the web page.
2. divides block elements into layout blocks and empty blocks.
3. scores the those blocks.
4. clusters the high score blocks that are next each others.
5. scores the clusters.
6. high score cluster is what we have been seeking. 
```

## Install

I prepare easy install way. Run the following command in your new terminal.

```
sudo easy_install "summary==0.1.1"
```

## Usage

Here is how you get summary from the web page.

```
from summary import extract
uri = 'web page you want to extract main text.'
res = extract(urllib.urlopen(uri).read())
print res['title'], '\n' # header of main content
print res['body'], '\n' # main content
print res['img'], '\n' # candidates of main images
```

Here is the way to override `is_collection_of_links()` and `not_body_rate()`, which are parts of extractor module, 
in response to your necessary. `is_collection_of_links()` decides whether layout block is a collection of links.

```
# /path/to/any.py
# include `is_collection_of_links()` for overriding
from summary import extractor

def _is_collection_of_links(block):
    # whether this layout block is a collection of links.
    print block
    return False

extractor.is_collection_of_links = _is_collection_of_links
```

`not_body_rate()` decides the rate which means that layout block is not body.

```
# /path/to/any.py
# include `not_body_rate()` for overriding
from summary import extractor

def _not_body_rate(block):
    # not_body_rate() takes account of not_body_rate.
    # return value has to be float or integer.
    print block
    return 0

extractor.not_body_rate = _not_body_rate
```
